## How it Works

1. Take a photo of your seed phrase using the camera
2. Enter a strong password when prompted
3. SeedSaver encrypts your photo using that password
4. Save the generated HTML file anywhere you like

To view your seed phrase later, just open the HTML file in any browser and enter your password.

## Security

- Your photo is encrypted locally on your device
- The password never leaves your device
- The HTML file contains only encrypted data
- Decryption happens in your browser when you enter the password
- No data is ever sent to any servers

## Best Practices

- Use a strong, unique password
- Store the HTML file in multiple secure locations
- Keep your password safe but separate from the HTML file
- Test decryption after saving to ensure everything works
- Consider encrypting multiple photos with different passwords
